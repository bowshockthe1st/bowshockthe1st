### Hey its Bowshock

3rd level system engineer focussed on Citrix - and quite some experience in file storage and profile virtualization. Kinda comes with the profession I guess.

If you randomly found this repo and there's something not private, I guess I forgot setting it that way.
Mostly for random .js and front-end dev stuff in my leisure time.
Sometimes a few PoSh thingies I use for work, but anonymised.

> Collaborating or needing help in Citrix? I certainly can try.
